The server was built using **nodeJS** and a **MYSQL** and it is connected
to a **react app** to give athletes the ultimate training platform.

My main goal with writing this server was to practice writing an OOP app while
discovering new features such as **nodemailer** (send-email.js),and **environment variables**(.env)                                                              and improving previously learned skills such as **file uploading**(files-controller.js).

I hope you will enjoy using this server.
